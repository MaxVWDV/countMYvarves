# countMYvarves
countMYvarves is a user interface based toolbox for counting annual sediment layers. A paper describing the details is currently in review in QR, I will post a link/citation here when it is published.

Note: the source code behind the apps is available in the following github repository: https://github.com/MaxVWDV/countMYvarves_source

Feel free to contact me at vanwy048@umn.edu for any questions, or for any more of the test-datasets described in our paper.
